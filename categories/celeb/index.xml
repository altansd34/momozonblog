As&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;turns out, many of&amp;nbsp;our favorite heroes were actually based on&amp;nbsp;very real people. For example, Conrad Veidt’s creepy smile became one of&amp;nbsp;the most recognizable features of&amp;nbsp;the Joker, Irene Bedard gave Pocahontas her Native American facial features, while John Nettleship shared his whole appearance and passion for chemistry with Severus Snape.
We&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;Bright Side found 15&amp;nbsp;iconic characters that were either loosely or&amp;nbsp;wholly based on&amp;nbsp;real people.</description></item><item><title>15 Women Who Ditched the Razor to Embrace Their Femininity on Their Terms</title><link>/15-woman-who-ditched-the-razor-to-embrace-their-femininity-on-their-terms-811790.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/15-woman-who-ditched-the-razor-to-embrace-their-femininity-on-their-terms-811790.html</guid><description>As&amp;nbsp;humans, we&amp;nbsp;all strive to&amp;nbsp;look and feel our best. However, society has long held certain beauty standards that can be&amp;nbsp;difficult to&amp;nbsp;meet. One of&amp;nbsp;the most significant examples is&amp;nbsp;the expectation for women to&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;hairless. But some women embrace their body hair and reject these societal expectations of&amp;nbsp;femininity. Let’s go&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;ride to&amp;nbsp;explore the journey of&amp;nbsp;several ladies who have gained confidence and self-love by&amp;nbsp;doing just that.

Sometimes looking at&amp;nbsp;family photo albums, we&amp;nbsp;experience different kinds of&amp;nbsp;emotions. Important life events, awkward shots, photobombs, and casual moments captured on&amp;nbsp;paper keep the memories alive. And quite often these memories make&amp;nbsp;us laugh out loud.

We’ve explored only&amp;nbsp;5% of&amp;nbsp;oceans.&amp;nbsp;12&amp;nbsp;people walked on&amp;nbsp;the Moon, but there were only four manned descents to&amp;nbsp;the Mariana Trench, the deepest location on&amp;nbsp;Earth. Pressure is&amp;nbsp;the crucial challenge of&amp;nbsp;going deep into the ocean. At&amp;nbsp;bigger depths, temperatures are extremely low, visibility is&amp;nbsp;zero, and the pressure is&amp;nbsp;so&amp;nbsp;intense it’s harder to&amp;nbsp;send people to&amp;nbsp;the bottom of&amp;nbsp;the ocean than to&amp;nbsp;send them into space.

Some of&amp;nbsp;these tattoos are so&amp;nbsp;unique that we&amp;nbsp;can hardly imagine these celebs without them&amp;nbsp;— almost as&amp;nbsp;if&amp;nbsp;they were birthmarks. But, of&amp;nbsp;course, that’s not the case. There was a&amp;nbsp;time when David Beckham, Lil Pump, Zayn Malik, and even Kat von&amp;nbsp;D had no&amp;nbsp;tattoos whatsoever.

Pink robins are only found in&amp;nbsp;the southeast part of&amp;nbsp;Australia.

There are also stars who decided to&amp;nbsp;make a&amp;nbsp;quiet exit from the spotlight.
Bright Side found out what 16&amp;nbsp;celebrities who were once super famous are up&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;today and what they look like now.

It’s no wonder consumer brands are trying to understand them and earn their attention. Gen Z adults are hard to win over, but trying to do so is worth the effort: Morning Consult’s Fastest Growing Brands research shows that brands break through with Gen Z first, then trickle up to older generations. So capturing young adults’ attention yields returns not just in the near term, but also down the road as they influence the zeitgeist.</description></item><item><title>Why You Still Dont Have a Six-Pack After Doing 1000 Crunches a Day</title><link>/why-you-still-dont-have-a-six-pack-after-doing-1000-crunches-a-day-800882.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/why-you-still-dont-have-a-six-pack-after-doing-1000-crunches-a-day-800882.html</guid><description>At&amp;nbsp;times, you might think it’s impossible to&amp;nbsp;get that shredded 6-pack, even though you’ve been doing ab&amp;nbsp;exercises for ages.

But this approach has existed throughout human history. Just think about tight corsets, bulky wigs, and crinoline dresses. People dutifully follow new fashion trends, sometimes despite their inconvenience and lack of&amp;nbsp;comfort.
At&amp;nbsp;Bright Side, we&amp;nbsp;agree that every coin has 2&amp;nbsp;sides, so&amp;nbsp;we&amp;nbsp;made up&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;list of&amp;nbsp;items that look good on&amp;nbsp;the runway but are completely impractical in&amp;nbsp;real life.
1. Silk suit
Silk is&amp;nbsp;very difficult to&amp;nbsp;care for.

In&amp;nbsp;fact, among women who know they’re pregnant, about&amp;nbsp;10% to&amp;nbsp;15% end in&amp;nbsp;miscarriage. Grieving mothers may blame themselves, thinking that their body is&amp;nbsp;broken when it’s not their fault at&amp;nbsp;all. The shame that comes with not being able to&amp;nbsp;keep the baby safe until birth is&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;stigma that these celebrities are trying to&amp;nbsp;change by&amp;nbsp;sharing their own experiences with miscarriages.
We&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;Bright Side feel that it’s important to&amp;nbsp;share these stories to&amp;nbsp;let women know that experiencing a&amp;nbsp;miscarriage doesn’t mean they’re not good enough.</description></item><item><title>28% of Britons say the outcome of general elections has little to no impact on them personally</title><link>/49956-28-of-britons-say-the-outcome-of-elections-general-elections-has-little-impact-on-them-personally.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/49956-28-of-britons-say-the-outcome-of-elections-general-elections-has-little-impact-on-them-personally.html</guid><description>General elections are the most major events in British politics, and after six weeks of relentless campaigning and media coverage you could be forgiven for thinking that the elections and their final result will have touched the lives of the whole country.

And the scariest part is&amp;nbsp;that it&amp;nbsp;can happen without you even noticing it&amp;nbsp;and realizing it’s happening. For example, you might always want to&amp;nbsp;go&amp;nbsp;above and beyond for your partner. They, on&amp;nbsp;the other hand, might give back very little. This dynamic can have disastrous effects on&amp;nbsp;you.
We&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;Bright Side want you to&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;aware of&amp;nbsp;this kind of&amp;nbsp;relationship and try to&amp;nbsp;avoid being in&amp;nbsp;one, and here`s why.</description></item><item><title>How Much Money Does Alice Braga Make?

This lures the bed bug out, like a&amp;nbsp;dinner bell.
This insect holds no&amp;nbsp;other purpose than contaminating your home. Without predators and with an&amp;nbsp;uncontested food supply in&amp;nbsp;your bed, it&amp;nbsp;leads a&amp;nbsp;very peaceful life.

Typically, new parents turn to&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;giant book of&amp;nbsp;names. However, others are happy to&amp;nbsp;just follow the family tradition and name their kids after their parents or&amp;nbsp;grandparents. Celebrities, on&amp;nbsp;the other hand, lean toward the avant-garde approach when it&amp;nbsp;comes to&amp;nbsp;naming their kids, which is&amp;nbsp;why many of&amp;nbsp;them have decided to&amp;nbsp;break typical stereotypes.
That’s why today at&amp;nbsp;Bright Side, we’d like to&amp;nbsp;introduce you to&amp;nbsp;13&amp;nbsp;kids with unique names along with their celebrity parents’ reasons to&amp;nbsp;name them in&amp;nbsp;such an&amp;nbsp;extravagant, but always meaningful way.</description></item><item><title>13Celebrities Who Used toLive onthe Street and Now Own Mansions</title><link>/13-celebrities-who-used-to-live-on-the-street-and-now-own-mansions-459310.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/13-celebrities-who-used-to-live-on-the-street-and-now-own-mansions-459310.html</guid><description>It’s hard to&amp;nbsp;become successful.

Besides their brick-like bodies, they also had long external antennas to&amp;nbsp;reach the cell network.
But as&amp;nbsp;time passed, electronic parts became smaller, and battery capacity increased enormously.

Today, almost all popular novels have 2&amp;nbsp;or more movie adaptations, so&amp;nbsp;we&amp;nbsp;can compare several “versions” of&amp;nbsp;the same character.
