The movie was directed by Quentin Tarantino and followed two hit men, Jules Winnfield (Samuel L Jackson) and Vincent Vega (Travolta). The film earned Travolta an Academy Award nomination. A scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is also on the list of the favourite film scenes of all time. After <i>Pulp Fiction</i>, John was back on the acting limelight.</p><p></p><p class=align-left>In 1995, the actor played the character Chill in the comedy <i>Get Shorty</i>. His performance in the novel-based movie won him a Golden Globe award. A sequel to Get Shorty was released in 2005 titled <i>Be Cool</i> but was not as successful as the first movie.</p><p class=align-left>Within the 90s decade, the actor appeared in films such as <i>Primary Colors</i> (1998), <i>Phenomenon </i>(1996) and <i>Arrow</i> (1996). John’s final film in the 90s was <i>The General’s Daughter</i> (1999). The beginning of the following decade was not very kind to the actor. His first movie of the decade <i>Battlefield Earth</i> (2000) was a massive miss. The film was based on a novel by Ron Hubbard, the Scientology founder. Despite the flop, the actor was back again, this time in the movie <i>Swordfish</i> (2001) alongside Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry. Other notable Travolta movies within that period included <i>Wild Hogs, Ladder 49 </i>and <i>Love Song for Bobby Long.</i></p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/282d9e895c046a94.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tony Sirico bio: age, height, wife, net worth, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 2007, the actor went back to his musical background in the movie adaptation of the Broadway hit <i>Hairspray</i>. The film tells the story of a plump young girl who wishes to perform in a local dance show. Travolta played the role of the girl’s mother (Edna). This was accomplished with the use of makeup, costumes, and wigs. The transformation of John into a large bubbly woman allowed him to showcase his vocal prowess in the film. Travolta’s performance in Hairspray earned him another Golden Globe nomination.</p><p class=align-left>In 2008, the actor was the voice of the lead role in Disney’s animated film <i>Bolt</i>. The movie revolves around a lost dog who believes that he has superpowers. He is accidentally shipped away into the mean streets of New York armed only with his superpower delusion and sets out to find his owner. John also performed the film’s ending credits duet with Miley Cyrus titled <i>I Thought I Lost You</i>. In 2009, John appeared in the comedy <i>Old Dogs</i> alongside Bernie Mac and Robin Williams. In 2010, the actor played Charlie in the action film <i>From Paris with Love</i>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0058c62935d41e62.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ryan Reynolds biography: Age, height, net worth, wife, kids</span></p></a><p></p><p class=align-left>In 2011, Travolta was played to play John Gotti, a mob boss in the film <i>Gotti</i>.

However, the two did not start dating until 1990 after Kelly broke up with her husband. The couple dated for one and a half years and got married in 1990 in Paris.

In 2006, the actor was alleged to have kissed a male colleague before boarding his private plane in Canada. In 2012, two men intended to sue the actor for emotional distress and sexual battery. Travolta’s former pilot (Douglas Gotterba) also claimed that he and the actor were involved in a relationship in the 1980s.</p><p class=align-left>However, Travolta dismissed all these allegations in 2014 and claimed them to be made up by people who wanted money from him. He termed the gay rumours as ‘every actor’s Achilles heel’. Travolta’s attorney (Marty Singer) also dismissed the claims. He claimed that his client’s accusers were looking for their fifteen minutes of fame by fabricating stories about things that supposedly took place.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Billie Eilish bio: age, family, songs, style, boyfriend</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/647c4642065e539e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All you need to know about Jason Sudeikis</span></p></a><h2>John Travolta net worth</h2><p class=align-left>The actor’s <a id=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/john-travoltas-net-worth-and-how-hes-still-making-moneyfrom-grease.html/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">current net worth</a> is estimated to be $170 million.
